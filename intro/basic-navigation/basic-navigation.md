# Basic navigation

This tutorial is about git.  But if you want to use git on files that aren't code, or even if you work with code but you just don't want to learn all the command-line flags, then we recommend DiffPlug.  DiffPlug is a piece of software that's similar to your operating system's file browser, except that it's built from the ground-up for looking at the *history* of files and comparing them.  Before you can work with git, there are just a couple things you need to know about basic navigation in DiffPlug first.

## Entity console

The **entity console** is the text box at top.  You can use it to navigate your files.  `Ctrl+P` will move the cursor there.

## Diff list

Click the ![DiffPlug icon](DiffPlugLogo_16.png) (or press `Ctrl+D`) to open the **diff list**.  When you move the mouse off of the diff list, it will close automatically.  If you drag a file onto the **diff list**, it will open automatically.

## Command console (where is the toolbar?)

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the **command console**.  The actions available are context-sensitive, based on the currently active pane.

## Diff schemas

DiffPlug has multiple ways to compare files.  To change which file in a diff is the `before` and which file is the `after`, drag their labels to swap.  If you'd like to change the type of the comparison, right-click the label.
