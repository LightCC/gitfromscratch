You will soon!  We'll start from the very beginning.

First we'll show you the [basics of navigating DiffPlug](basic-navigation/).  Then, we'll either show you how to [create a new repository](create-new-repository/) or [clone an existing repository](clone-existing-repository/), depending on whether you want to start a new project or work on an existing one.

Once you've got a project, you'll [make a commit](make-a-commit/), and voila!  You've made your very own history.
