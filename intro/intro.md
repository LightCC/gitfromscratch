# I don't know anything about git or version control

You will soon!  We'll start from the very beginning.

First we'll show you the [basics of navigating DiffPlug](basic-navigation/).  If you're already tinkering with git then we'll [open up your existing working copy](open-existing-working-copy/).  If you're brand new, we'll tell you what a working copy is in the first place and how to [get one of your own](get-).

Then, we'll either show you how to [open a working copy that's already on your computer](open-working-copy/), [create a new repository](create-new-repository/), or [clone an existing repository](clone-existing-repository/), depending on whether you want to start a new project or work on an existing one.

Once you've got a project, you'll [make a commit](make-a-commit/), and voil√†!  You've made your very own history.
