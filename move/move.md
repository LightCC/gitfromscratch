# Move work through time? What?

Normally, work only counts if you base it on the latest version of a document.  Git allows you to move work through time, which allows you to structure your work in new and productive ways.  In this section, we'll explore the mechanics which make moving work possible.

We'll start by explaining how to [merge](merge/) two streams of work.  Next, we'll explain how you can extract the essence of a change into a [patch](patch/), which you can use to transplant your work into the past or the future.  To make this time travel more concrete, we'll [move a single commit](cherry-pick-and-rebase/), and then take the next natural step to [move an entire branch](cherry-pick-and-rebase/).
