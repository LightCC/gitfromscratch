Normally, you use your desktop and Windows Explorer / Mac Finder / Linux Nautilus to look at files.  But these interfaces are designed for looking at files at one instant in time.  DiffPlug was designed for looking at the history of files and comparing them.  So there's just a couple things you need to know about basic navigation in DiffPlug first.

The [D] icon brings up the *DiffManager*.  This is just a scratchpad where you can put files that you're interested in for comparing them later.  To put a file on the DiffList, drag it there from your desktop.  You can also drag files to the "D" icon and they'll be added to the DiffList.

Alternatively, you can find a file using fuzzy search using the browse bar.
