# I know how to commit, but I don't know how branches work.

Branches are way simpler than commits, so you're in good shape.

First we'll show you [what a branch is, and how you can use one to make new commits](sticky-notes-and-paintbrushes/sticky-notes-and-paintbrushes.md).  Then we'll show you how to [look at the history of a branch](reflog/reflog.md).  At this point, you'll have the bread and butter of branches down, so we can show you [a handy method for saving unfinished work](save-for-later/save-for-later.md).
