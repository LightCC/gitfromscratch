You can now take advantage of all that git has to offer - not just the trivial parts, but the If there are parts that you feel could have been described better, let us know in the [live chat](https://gitter.im/diffplug/gitfromscratch).  This entire book was built using Git, so you can see the process by which it was created on [its GitHub page](https://github.com/diffplug/gitfromscratch).  Because it is licensed under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), you are free to make your own changes and distribute it however you wish!

There are a few places where we have [departed from vanilla git](departures/departures.md) in a significant way.  We are not rebels without cause, our [cause is right here](departures/departures.md).
