# Move work through time? What?

Normally, work only counts if you base it on the latest version of a document.  In the introduction, I claimed that git would allow you to move work through time to the latest version, which would allow you to structure your work in new and productive ways.  In this section, we'll explore the mechanics which make moving work possible.

We'll start by explaining how to [merge](Merge.md) two streams of work.  To gain insight into how these merges actually work, we'll look at how you can [move a single commit](Commit.md) - which is a useful skill in its own right.  Having moved a single commit, the next natural step is to [move an entire branch](Branch.md).
