# Epilogue

You can now take advantage of all that git has to offer - not just the trivial parts, but the good parts too!

If there are parts that you feel could have been described better, let us know in the [live chat](https://gitter.im/diffplug/gitfromscratch).  This entire book was built using Git, so you can see the process by which it was created on [its GitHub page](https://github.com/diffplug/gitfromscratch).  Because it is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, you are free to make your own changes and distribute it however you wish!
