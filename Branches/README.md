## I know how to commit, but I don't know how branches work.

Branches are way simpler than commits, so you're in good shape.

First we'll show you [what a branch is, and how you can use one to make new commits](Branches.md).  Then we'll show you how to [look at the history of a branch](Reflog.md).  Once you can manipulate lone branches, we'll show you how to [smush them together](Merging.md).

At this point, you'll have the bread and butter of branches down, so we can show you [tags](Tags.md) and [a handy method for saving unfinished work](SaveForLater.md).
